Pure Python RSA implementation
==============================

As an assignment for the University of Amsterdam we wrote a pure Python RSA
implementation. It's a module for calculating large primes, and RSA encryption,
decryption, signing and verification. It also includes generating public and
private keys.

Download and install using:

    pip install rsa

or download it from the `Python Package Index`_.
